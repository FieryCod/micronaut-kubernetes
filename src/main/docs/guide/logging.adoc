If you need to debug the HTTP calls made to the Kubernetes API, you need to set the `io.micronaut.http.client` logger level
to `TRACE`:

[source,xml]
----
<logger name="io.micronaut.http.client" level="TRACE"/>
----

Also, you can set a higher level (`DEBUG` or `TRACE`) for this configuration module logging.

[source,xml]
----
<logger name="io.micronaut.kubernetes" level="TRACE"/>
----

Other package that might produce relevant logging is `io.micronaut.discovery`, which belongs to Micronaut Core.

In addition to that, another source of information is
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#environmentEndpoint[the Environment Endpoint], which outputs all
the resolved ``PropertySource``s from ``ConfigMap``s, and their corresponding properties.
