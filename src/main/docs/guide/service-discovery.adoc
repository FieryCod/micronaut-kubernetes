The Service Discovery module allows Micronaut HTTP clients to discover Kubernetes services.

To get started, you need to declare the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-kubernetes-discovery-client:{version}[]

Then, in any client you can use as Service ID the Kubernetes `Endpoints` name generated by a Kubernetes `Service`.

Consider the following Kubernetes service definition:

[source,yaml]
.`my-service.yml`
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
----

This specification will create a new `Service` object named `my-service`, as well as an `Endpoints` object also named `my-service`.

In your HTTP client, you can use `my-service` as Service ID: `@Client("my-service")`.
